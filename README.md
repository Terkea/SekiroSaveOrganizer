The main idea wraps around the save file generated by the game.
Let's suppose at one point you would like to go backwards just to fight one boss again without having to create a new save file, or you have just one sugar left, for example say you want use that sugar during the boss fight, but what if you didn't kill him from the first attempt? What if you died and besides that you lost your precious consumable, that's when this program becomes really useful. You could just make a save file before the boss fight where you have the consumable and if you die you would just load the save file.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
<a href="data:application/octet-stream,DATA" download="FILENAME">TITLE</a>

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

The way it works is quite simple as long as you're aware of some things.
For example once downloaded the program it is going to ask you to pick up the actual save file from ```%APPDATA%``` and it's going to store that location in the ```config.terkea``` file

Then the actual interface will load, where you can create, load and delete save files.

The ```create new save file``` option is not related to the path from where you run the program. Which means that at one point you decide to change the location of the program your savefiles are safe.

The way it works:
It copies the savefile from %APPDATA% to the saves/savename folder.
Also the name has to be unique in order to use it as identifier.

The same principle is used in the ```loading save file```, it copies the savefile to the ```Sekiro %APPDATA% location```.

```Delete``` it's just delete, it permanently deletes the savefile and the entry from table view.
